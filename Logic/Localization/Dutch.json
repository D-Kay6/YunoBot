		"Autochannel default": "Auto channels are a means to keeping your server clean and don't have unnecessary channels like 'voice 1, voice 2, etc'.
These auto channels are voice channels that have a prefix in their name, so I can recognize them.
When a user joins such a voice channel, I will generate a new voice channel with the same permissions and settings in the category the auto channel is in.
I will also give the user permission to modify the channel.
Once everything's done I will move the user to the new channel.
When all users have left the generated voice channel, I will remove it.

When setting up an auto channel, you need to make sure I have at least the `manage channels` permission.
If you never changed my standard permissions, I should have the `administrator` permission, which works just as well.
Create a channel with the auto channel prefix (you can get this through `/autochannel prefix`) followed by a name of your choosing.
You can set-up your own prefix for auto channels with `/autochannel prefix set <prefix>`.

You can customize the name generated channels have with `/autochannel name set <name>`.
You can add `{0}` to fill in the possessive form of the user's name.
Example:
/autochannel name set {0} channel
Result -> D-Kay's channel",

		"Permachannel default": "Perma channels are for when you want users to be able to have their own channels without having to bother admins.
These perma channels are voice channels that have a prefix in their name, so I can recognize them.
When a user joins such a voice channel, I will generate a new voice channel with the same permissions and settings in the category the perma channel is in.
I will also give the user permission to modify the channel.
Once everything's done I will move the user to the new channel.
